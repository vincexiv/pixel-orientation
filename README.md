# Pixel orientation

This is just a test for the arctan function used to calculate the angle of pixels in an image. It does the tests on digits obtained from git. The expectation is that for each of the number, the orientation of each pixel making up the digit is shown.

The test also includes a test for how the average calculated orientation for each pixel making up the figure changes when the image has been rotated. This part is kind of not important for this test and can thus be ignored
